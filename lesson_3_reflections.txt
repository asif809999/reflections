When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When there is a group project and group member are working in different places I would like to create a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
works can be finished in a organized way through manual pull.
