When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When there is a group project and group member are working in different places I would like to create a remote repository.

works can be finished in a organized way through manual pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fors are done inside Github(online server), Clones are done from github to local machine, branches are done both locally and inside github(onlie).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
working without having internet connection is possible for a while.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
emailing zipped file of the project :D. when there will be lot of team members it will be harder to work togather. Emailing a project is an easy task :).

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
when there are some new features to add, branche is a good way to do work. But working on the master make the workflow less complicated.
